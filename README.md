# VRChatAdvancedPack2019.4.29f1
A All-In-One VRChat Unity  Avatar Package made for Toggles + useful tools.


This package is made for object toggles & includes everything you need pre-build. It does not include how to make gestures, sitting etc. animations/emotes.

This is a Unity Package made for VRChat Avatars 3.0 SDK, which includes:

    Latest VRCSDK3-AVATAR-2021.08.04.11.23_Public
    Default rigged avatar
    A mesh for measuring your height in cm & meter
    5 Main Folders:

    3.0 Animations (Menu & Parameter Folder thath includes the Parameter & Menu's), (Animation Folder with the Action & FX Layer)
    Animations for any animations
    Audio
    Materials
    Objects

    Top Menu (Which is the Expressions Button in VRChat. Where you can more Sub Menus, like Emotes, Objects etc or just Toggles)
    Two Sub-Menus (Default Emotes & Objects) already added to the Top Menu.
    Parameter
    3 Expression Menus (Default_Emotes, Objects, SFX)
    Default Action Layer & a custom FX Layer for Playable Layers

The materials called "DELETE" are only placeholders. Delete them!

    It acts like a all in one package made for toggles + a measuring tool.

Here is a YouTube tutorial from me.

I made this package, because some people in the Discord Server from VRChat, had problems doing toggles. The YouTube tutorial didN#t helped them.
This package + my video could help.

Report any issues.
